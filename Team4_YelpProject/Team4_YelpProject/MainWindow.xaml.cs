// The following channel by Code Advocate has a 12 part 'Beginners guide to MVVM Pattern using WPF in C#' playlist that
//  heavily influenced how this project was made. Code Advocate took the time to not only demonstrate writing a MVVM code,
//  also took the time to explain the hows and whys for binding and layout.

//
// The following Microsoft Docs page basically showed how to bind a treeview, did not complicate the matter talking about
//  the objects being bound. Extremely helpful as it did not clutter the explaination with weird ways of making classes
//  for binding purposes.
